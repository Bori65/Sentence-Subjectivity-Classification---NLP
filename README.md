Multilingual Text Classification with Transformers

This project implements multilingual text classification using [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).  
It supports training and testing on datasets in multiple languages (English, German, Italian, Arabic, Bulgarian).  

The model used is **DistilBERT (multilingual, cased)**, trained for subject/object classification.  
Both **baseline** and **optimized** training setups are provided.
